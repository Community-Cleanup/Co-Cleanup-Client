        "After a natural disaster strikes, communities are often left with the enormous clean-up effort required to restore people's homes, businesses and community areas. During these times government, council and emergency services resources are often stretched thin. Co Cleanup, short for Community Clean-up, aims to help communities better coordinate the clean-up process after a natural disaster, or any time that community members would like to coordinate group action for the betterment of their community. Clean-up tasks may involve the removal of debris, non-hazardous waste, and/or minor repairs, removal or replacements of small objects such as plants, furniture or garbage.",
